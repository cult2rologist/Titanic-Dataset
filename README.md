# __Titanic dataset exploratory analysis__

##### With this project, I want to learn data analysis approaches using Python and special libraries such as:
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib.pyplot


##### There won't be any specific questions I want to ask this data before getting started. I will explore as many questions as I can during the process. Some of the research may be redundant and not practically useful for a real-case data analysis. However, primarily, this project focuses on working with data visualization tools. Throughout the process, I will enhance my ability to understand and work with data in Python.
