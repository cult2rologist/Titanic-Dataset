# __Titanic dataset exploratory analysis__

#### It is a deep dive into data visualization with a project using the Titanic dataset and Python tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I mastered 5 new visualization techniques, crafting box plots to reveal gender-based outliers in age and survival, histogram plots to analyze child distribution across classes, and even linear regression models to explore fascinating interrelationships between age, survival, and gender.

This project has been a significant stepping stone in my continuous learning journey, providing a solid foundation for more advanced explorations in the field of data analysis.
